## Notion: Why you should use it as an IT Major

> I discovered Notion around early September in 2021 and I want to dedicate this page just for that.

* **_What is Notion?_**

  * Notion is an application that allows for a user to create the best organization habitat for whatever profession or lifestyle you live.

* **_How can Notion be useful for me?_**

  * Well that's easy. You have the patience and the drive to learn the profession you want to do, correct?
  * But maybe you have a lot of documents or files or code that needs to be organized.
  * Notion's got you.

* **_What Notion can do:_**
  * Notion allows for the user to customize there pages and links and add in just about any embed document you can think of.
  * You can also add files, code, videos, images, and incorperate material from other apps just by connecting both the accounts.
  * The application is even easily compatiable with Slack!
  * You can also download any of your pages or work into several different formats.
  * One of such download formats includes: Markdown!

### **Here is a sample of the said Markdown from my own personal Notion:**
> I disabled the links since you won't be able to access my Notion even if I gave you the link.

> That isn't all of it thought, because here is one of my subpages under one of the module toggle lists I have. You can see in the picture my code and Professor Musser's from the past retrospective. Notion can read pleanty of programs including Python, Plain Text, HTML, Java, Markdown and more.

> There's plenty more you can do with Notion, and they offer a large range of templates for you to experiment with when your first starting out. You can change the display screen (I prefer dark mode) and if you decide to upgrade to one of there plans that requires a monthly payment, you can have people visit your Notion page.

> Besides that, the only thing I can tell you is to check it out for yourself. You can do there Free plan and decide for yourself if you think Notion will help you. 

> It's definetly helped me to organize all my coding projects and module objectives that I do in each of my course. 

> Lastly, I'll display some additional photos of other pages on my Notion to show you layouts I created and designed to my interest.

* Besides all that, your Notion page isn't permament. You can change it as much as you want, and believe me I change mine often. 

* I hope this info page incouraged you to take a look at Notion and try it out.
